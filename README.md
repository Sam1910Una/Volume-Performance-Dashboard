# Project Goal: 
To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive and visually driven overview of volume performance, enabling users to quickly understand key trends, identify top performers, and analyze performance across various dimensions.

# Target Audience:

Shipping Managers and Executives: To gain insights into overall volume performance, identify areas for improvement, and make strategic decisions.
Logistics Coordinators and Analysts: To monitor daily operations, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and identify potential bottlenecks.
Sales and Customer Service Teams: To understand customer volume trends, identify top customers, and provide better service.
Operations and Planning Teams: To analyze volume by location, office, and container type for efficient resource allocation and planning.
Supply Chain Professionals: To track the flow of goods and identify areas for optimization.
Principals and Stakeholders: To monitor the performance of their shipping volumes.

# Data Source: 
 SQL

# Key Objectives :

Provide a high-level overview of total TEUs and containers: Clearly display key volume metrics for immediate understanding.
Analyze volume trends over time: Show current vs. previous year counts to identify growth or decline.
Identify top performing sectors and customers: Highlight key contributors to volume.
Analyze volume by office and location: Visualize geographic performance and identify regional strengths.
Understand volume distribution across principles: Show the contribution of different shipping principles.
Enable interactive filtering and exploration: Allow users to filter data by principal, office, container type, and location.
# Dashboard Features :

Key Metrics Display: Prominent display of Total TEUs (531.00K) and Total Containers (256.969K).
Trend Analysis: Bar chart showing Current vs. Previous Year Count with clear labels and values.
Top Performers:
Donut chart showing Top 20 Sectors by TEUs with percentage breakdown.
Table displaying Top 20 Customers with their respective TEU counts.
Geographic Analysis:
World map with location markers and color-coding to visualize TEUs by location.
Donut chart showing TEUs by Office with percentage breakdown.
Principal Analysis: Bar chart visualizing TEUs by Principle.
Interactive Filters: Dropdown filters for Principal, Office, Container Type, and Location.
Container Type Breakdown: Display of TEUs for 20' and 40' containers.
Year Filter: Slider to filter data by year.
Potential Enhancements (Based on the Image and General Best Practices):

Data Refresh Schedule: Implement automated data refresh to ensure the dashboard reflects the latest information.
Drill-Down Capabilities: Add the ability to drill down into specific data points for more detailed analysis.
Tooltips: Add tooltips to visualizations for additional context and information.
KPI Definition: Clearly define the KPIs being tracked and their relevance.
Performance Optimization: Optimize the dashboard for fast loading and responsiveness.
Accessibility: Ensure the dashboard is accessible to users with disabilities.
Mobile Responsiveness: Consider designing the dashboard for mobile viewing.
